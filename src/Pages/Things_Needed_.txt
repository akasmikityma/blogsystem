now a array has to be created that holds all the note that is written in the textArea of the CreateBlog Page and then that e.target.value is added
to the existing array >> 
that array is a state which is in the Context and then its called in the CreateBlog page to update the array and then called in the 
Home Page so that all the array elements are shown in form of Cards >>>

so make another Context folder and then have BlogContext.js and BlogContextProvider.jsx that provides the Context>>


if the textArea is emoty after an addition and the user clicks the add button then an alert comes that the textArea is empty>>

  *** Obviously first understand that how that worked 
1/ make the delte button function and the css needs to be shorted .. 

... delete Note [done]..
...  so first clicking to the edit on the card take me to the editBlog where i fix the text and then again click the add that gets again added
     to the home page but in the same exact index .. that's the catch >>

     1. index has to be taken care 
     2. the existing text has to be there in the editBlog>>
